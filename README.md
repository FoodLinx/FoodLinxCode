# FoodLinxCode

Source Code For FoodLinx ALX SWE Portfolio Project

## Project Structure

1. ~/home folder contains this README.md and a folder "src" that contains the source code
2. The "src" folder has two separate projects. One for the backend (nodejs, express) api and the frontend (reactjs) apps
3. The database will be hosted on an cloud based MongoDB cluster. The connection string to the database will be shared privately via a .env file and not stored on this repo.

## Starter Project

As a basis for this project it will be a simple MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, NodeJS) "Hello world". The backend will contain the nodejs and express server which will retrieve the text "Hello World" and and send it to the react frontend which shall then display it on to the client (browser)
